# Chess AI

After being stuck at 900 elo rating on chess.com, I think my only good response to someone saying "Let's play chess" is to say, "Sure, but you can go up against my AI". 

The goal of this repo is to implement the chess game from scratch and in the future train an agent to play and get better at it :)
